        <p class="styled-paragraph">One successful story is from Nepal, where the World Food Programme (WFP) has used helicopters to deliver food to remote, mountainous regions. During the 2015 earthquake, many villages were cut off from road access due to landslides and damaged infrastructure. The WFP's use of helicopters ensured that essential supplies reached these isolated communities, providing much-needed relief in a time of crisis. Another example is the Andes region in South America. In areas like Peru and Bolivia, improvements in road infrastructure have significantly enhanced food distribution. Projects funded by the government and international organizations have built better roads and bridges, making it easier for farmers to transport their produce to markets. This not only improves food availability but also boosts the local economy by allowing farmers to sell their goods more efficiently.</p>
