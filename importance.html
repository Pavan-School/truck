        <p class="styled-paragraph">The challenges of food distribution in mountainous regions include difficult accessibility due to narrow and winding roads that are prone to landslides and avalanches. Limited infrastructure, such as insufficient roads and storage facilities, 
        further complicates efficient food distribution. Harsh weather conditions, including heavy snowfall and extreme temperatures, can disrupt the transportation of food supplies. Additionally, many mountain communities face economic hardships, limiting their ability to purchase food. These factors collectively make it challenging to ensure timely and reliable delivery of food to these remote areas.</p>
